            <p class="text-title">MY STORY</p>
            <p>
            I obtained a Bachelor in Business Administration and Management at the University of Barcelona in 2012. Once I finished my studies, I took up a career path as an accountant, growing up until I became a team manager.
            <br>
            Six years later, I realized that this path no longer fulfilled me. I needed a new challenge where I could keep on growing as a profesional.
            <br>
            Coincidentally, in that period, I met someone who introduced me to programming and showed me a new way of creating, thinking and doing. I felt fascinated by a community that enjoys sharing knowledge and follows an array of principles to which I could easily relate to.
            <br>
            I felt an irresistible need to explore this field: stepping out of my confort zone was not easy but I slowly started taking steps in this direction.</p>
            <p class="text-title">NOWADAYS</p>
            <p>
            I have been learning by myself since the beginning of 2019 and I am currently enrolled in a programming bootcamp in Skylab to consolidate and expand my knowledge.
            <br>
            I have focused in various full stack technologies, libraries and frameworks (e.g. Javascript, React, SASS, BEM, MongoDB, Node, Express, etc). I enjoy implementing personal projects like this web site and test my new skills during my spare time.</p>
            <p class="text-title">PASSIONS</p>
            <p>Besides programming, I am dedicated to following a healthy lifestyle. I pay close attention to what I eat, and regularly exercise. Moreover, I love dancing, up to the point that I joined an amateur salsa dance company.</p>
