            <p class="text-title">NOWADAYS</p>
            <p>I'm a Full Stack web development student at Skylab. I work with Javascript, CSS, HTML, and some libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap. I allow my couriosity to grow every day by learning new technologies.</p>
            <p class="text-title">CONTEXT</p>
            <p>I obtained a Bachelor in Business Administration and Management at the University of Barcelona. Once I finished my studies, I started working in Administration as accountant, administrative and team manager.
            <br>
            Those were good job positions, but I didn't know why I wasn't feeling fulfilled. It hit me when I realized that I couldn't find anything else to learn, or at least a topic I would find interesting to dive in. It was very clear: I was following the wrong path.
            <br>
            One day, I met someone who introduce me to programming and showed me a new way of thinking and doing, a community that enjoys sharing their knowledge, and principles of which I could easily relate to. I felt unavoidable attracted to the field and I decided to take a step in that direction, leaving my comfort zone behind.</p>
            <p class="text-title">PASIONS</p>
            <p>I enjoy implementing personal projects like this web site and test my news skills during my spare time. Besides programming, I like keeping myself active and following a healthy lifestyle. I put close attention to what I eat, and I regularly do physical exercise. Moreover, I love dancing, up to the point that I joined an amateur salsa company. </p>
