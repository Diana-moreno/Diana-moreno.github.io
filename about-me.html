            <p class="text-title">Nowadays</p>
            <p>I'm a Full Stack web development student at Skylab. I basicaly work with Javascript, CSS, HTML, and some libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap. All I do is let my couriosity grow every day.</p>
            <p class="text-title">Context</p>
            <p>I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Management in the University of Barcelona. Once I finished my studies, I started working in Administration in perfils like administrative, accountant and team manager.
            <br>
            The jobs were good but I didn't know why I wasn't feeling fullfiled. I realized that something was happened when I coudn't find anything to be formed in, anything interested me. It was clear: I was in the wrong way.
            <br>
            One day, I met someone who introduce me in the programming and showed me a new way to think, a new way to do, a community that enjoys sharing its knowledge and some valours which I fit with. Inevitably I falled in love with both and I decided to make the step leaving my confort zone.</p>
            <p class="text-title">Pasions</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to create personal projects like this web site and test my news skills.
            Besides programming, I like to stay active and have a healthy life.
            I take care about the food I eat and I practise fitness regulary.
            I also really love to dance salsa. Until recently, I have belonged to an amateur salsa dance company, but I had to do a break to have more time to study and be able to change my career.</p>
