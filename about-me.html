            <p class="text-title">NOWADAYS</p>
            <p>I'm an apasionate and autodidact Full Stack web development. I began to study in february 2019 by myself and in october, I decided to start a programming bootcamp in Skylab to consolidate and expand my knowledge. I have focused in Javascript, React, SASS, BEM, MongoDB and Express. I really enjoy learning new technologies every day.</p>
            <p class="text-title">CONTEXT</p>
            <p>I graduated the Bachelor of Business Administration and Management at the University of Barcelona. I started working as Administrative in a Driving School during 2 years. After that, I joined the Administration department in a Parking Lot company during 4 years, going from accountant to team manager.
            <br>
            All of them were good job positions, but I wasn't feeling fulfilled and one day I inevitably realised that I had been following the wrong path.
            <br>
            Fortunatelly, at this point I met someone who introduce me to programming, a field which I have been always attracted to, and showed me a new way of thinking and doing, a community that enjoys sharing their knowledge, and principles of which I could easily relate to. So finally, I decided to take a step in that direction, leaving my comfort zone behind.</p>
            <p class="text-title">PASIONS</p>
            <p>During my spare time, I enjoy implementing personal projects testing my news skills. Besides programming, I like keeping myself active and following a healthy lifestyle. I put close attention to what I eat, and I regularly do physical exercise. Moreover, I love dancing, up to the point that I joined an amateur salsa dance company.</p>
