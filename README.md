### 1. [Calculator](https://diana-moreno.github.io/calculator/)

In this project, I have coded a simple and functional calculator.<br><br>
**Features:**
- Allows to operate with nested parentheses expressions.
- Allows do and undo movements.
- Allows reset and start new calculations.
- It's able to acummulate values for the next operation.
- If the expression is malformed, shows a message.
- If the expression is too long, the font size is reduced to fit in display.
- It has been configurated for many sizes of screen and dispositives.
- Has intuitive colors when operating to be more easily to use
- Works properly both with keyboard and mouse.
