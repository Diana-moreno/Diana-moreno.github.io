### ABOUT ME
My name is Diana Moreno and nowadays, I am a Full Stack Web Development student at Skylab Coding Bootcamp.<br>
I decided to change my career a few months ago, so I had to package and leave the Administration and Accountancy’s world behind, starting a new whole tech path.<br>
Since I discovered this field, I haven’t stopped learning, and I love it.<br>

### PROJECTS
In this section I will be uploading a few of my personal tech projects.<br> 
If you want to discuss something about them, just contact me.

### 1. [Calculator](https://diana-moreno.github.io/calculator/)

In this project, I have coded a simple and functional calculator.<br>
The purpose was to practice with the mix of CSS, HTML, logic Javascript and mouse and keyboard events.<br><br>
**Features:**
- Allows to operate with nested parentheses expressions.
- There's a button to delete the last character introduced.
- Includes reset button to start new calculations.
- It's able to acummulate values for the next operation.
- If the expression is malformed, shows a message.
- If the expression is too long, the font size is reduced to fit in display.
- It has been configurated for many sizes of screen and dispositives.
- Has intuitive colors when operating to be more easily to use
- Works properly both with keyboard and mouse.
