## ABOUT ME

I'm a new coder that have changed my career a few months ago, leaving behind the administration and accountancy's world.\n
Since I know about this field, I haven't stopped learning and I love it.

### PROJECTS

In this section I will be uploading a few of my personal tech projects. 
If you want to discus something about them, just contact me.
